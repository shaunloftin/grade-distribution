# Ohio State Grade Distribution Analysis

## Description
Inspired by a [r/OSU reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/gljeqv/see_past_grade_distributions_for_the_ohio_state/) on grade distributions, we wanted to explore the distributions among Ohio State major and general education courses.

This project hasn't been updated since Summer 2020.

## Main Goals
* Explore different majors, find 4 year programs and analyze how rigorous different majors
* Identify the top "weed out classes"
      - Are these "weed out classes" getting easier/harder over given semesters?
* What are the easiest GE classes?
